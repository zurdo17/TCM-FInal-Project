# TCM-Final-Project
Our goal for the class project is to help students prepare for medical school interviews.
prepare for the interviews they will face. The second hardest part of getting an acceptance to a specific Med School is the interview process. Recruiters want to see how well you fit with their School's culture and what can you bring to them. These interviews  truly measure the difference between your Undergrad experience and how you are on a normal day-to-day. At the end of the day, your grades do not mean much if you are not able to actually represent your skills and contributions out of a classroom. 

That is why we decided to create this platform, called the Medical School Interview Preparation Tool.

The Medical School Interview Preparation Tool allows to practice random interveiw questions asked at the medical school of their liking. It counts with a database of tens of thousands of interview questions asked at 175 US-acreddited allopathic medical schools across the country and internationally, all questions being scraped from Student Doctor Network, one of pre-med's most vital sources of medical school information.

By randomly receiving and answering interview questions at the school of their choice, medical school applicants can take their interview preparation to another level.
