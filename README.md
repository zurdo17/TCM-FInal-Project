# TCM-Final-Project
Our goal for the class project is to help students interviewing for Medical School
prepare for the interviews they will face. The second hardest part of getting an acceptance to a specific Med School is the interview process. Recruiters want to see how well you fit with their School's culture and what can you bring to them. These interviews  truly measure the difference between your Undergrad experience and how you are on a normal day-to-day. At the end of the day, your grades do not mean much if you are not able to actually represent your skills and contributions out of a classroom. 

That is why we decided to create this platform.

The program allows its user to select which School they would like their interview
questions be based on and with the web scrapper, the program will deliver a random question
known to be asked during the interviews of that specific school

The database has over 175 Med Schools in the US. Each Med Schools has at least 5 questions, with some having more than a 1000. 
The user is able to test their preparation for that interview.
